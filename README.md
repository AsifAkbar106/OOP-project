EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


The event management system is a console application developed in C++ that allows users to efficiently manage various types of events. The project provides a range of functionalities for creating, displaying, and deleting events.

The project offers the following features:

Add Events: Users can add different types of events, such as concerts, conferences, sports events, exhibitions, theatre plays, workshops, social gatherings, and exhibition openings. Each event type has specific attributes that can be provided by the user, such as the event name, date, location, capacity, artist(s), speaker(s), and other relevant details. The events are dynamically created and stored in a vector for efficient management.

Display Events: Users can view the details of all the events currently stored in the system. The program will display the information specific to each event type, such as concert name, date, location, artist, conference name, start date, end date, location, and capacity.

Delete Events by Name: Users can delete events by providing the name of the event they want to delete. The program will search for events with matching names and delete them from the system.

Polymorphism: The project utilizes the concept of polymorphism, where the base class "Event" serves as a common interface for all event types. This allows for code reusability and a structured design. Derived event classes override the common functions and provide specific implementations based on the event type.

Object-Oriented Design: The project follows object-oriented programming principles, organizing the code into classes and utilizing inheritance to create a hierarchy of event types. This design allows for modular and extensible code.

Overall, the event management system project provides a user-friendly interface for managing events efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and delete events with ease, providing a comprehensive solution for event management needs.
